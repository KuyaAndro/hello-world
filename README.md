This repository is for practicing the GitHub Flow.
I'm Alessandro, a student at Map√∫a University with a strong interest in both technical and creative fields. I approach my studies with a rational mindset, often using both rationalist and empiricist methods to fully understand complex topics. My academic journey is a mix of practical projects and theoretical exploration, such as creating instructional videos, conducting research on IT tools, and analyzing user satisfaction with design platforms like Canva. In group projects, I strive to be a reliable collaborator, contributing effectively and stepping up to take leadership when needed. I enjoy exploring technology and its real-world applications, particularly how it can improve processes and solve problems. I always aim for clear communication and delivering high-quality results in my work. Outside of school, I maintain a balanced lifestyle and focus on personal growth. My approach to learning and my work is driven by a genuine passion for developing skills that not only help me grow but also contribute to the community around me.
